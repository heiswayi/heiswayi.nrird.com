### Quotes from reading some articles on the Internet

> I’ve learned too (the hard way) that no job is secure.  The only thing that is secure in life is you – your spirit, your heart, your talents and gifts, and your ability to contribute at a high level to something that matters to you in life. When you live from that knowledge and experience, you’ll find (and create) gainful, rewarding work no matter where you go, despite the turbulence around you. And to do that, you need to continually push yourself out of your comfort zone.

——Mary, _What if Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone Led You to Your Dream Job?_

> If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.
