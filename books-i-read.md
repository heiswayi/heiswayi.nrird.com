title: Books I Read
description: Mission 2020 - to read more books, and record them here.
---

The intention of this page is to keep track of my book reading. I should be doing this earlier. From year 2020 onwards, I will try my best to read more books either in the form of physical copy or digital copy and record them here. I have the same thought as [this guy when he asked the HN community about reading books](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21955258).
