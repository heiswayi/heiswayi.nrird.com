Another EXIF Reader is a simple GUI tool built in .NET C# and WPF to simply extract the image metadata called EXIF data. This tool also can export the EXIF data into a text file or CSV file. This is made using [MetadataExtractor](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet) library for extracting the EXIF data.
