It's been a considerable stretch since my last entry on this blog. Life has taken me on a journey filled with enriching experiences, particularly the precious moments spent with my daughter. Today, I feel compelled to document a significant chapter, a historical moment that has unfolded in the year 2020 and captured the attention of the entire world â€” COVID-19.

## A glimpse into COVID-19

COVID-19 or coronavirus disease 2019 is defined as illness caused by novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009.

### Things that happened in my country (Malaysia) during the COVID-19 outbreak

Most of the countries around the world have been doing their best to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) during this outbreak and my country is one of them.

In Malaysia, there are few stages of lockdown or movement control order (MCO) implemented by the government:

- Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO)
- Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO)
- Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO)

Following periods are the phases that implemented during the MCO:

- Phase 1: 18/03/2020 - 31/03/2020
- Phase 2: 01/04/2020 - 14/04/2020
- Phase 3: 15/04/2020 - 28/04/2020
- Phase 4: 29/04/2020 - 12/05/2020
- Phase 5: 13/05/2020 - 09/06/2020 (CMCO)
- Phase 6: 10/06/2020 - 31/08/2020 (RMCO)
