It's been a while since my last update on this blog. I have been busy doing something better in my life and spending good quality times with my daughter. Today, I want to write something here. A biggest historic moment in my life so I will not forget about it in future. So I could tell my daughter about it later. Of course, we don't know what will happen next in the future, but now, this is the biggest event that's happening and surprising to the world, in this year, 2020. It's called COVID-19.

### A brief info about COVID-19

COVID-19 or coronavirus disease 2019 is defined as illness caused by novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009.

### Things that happened in my country (Malaysia) during COVID-19 outbreak

Most of the countries around the world have been doing their best to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) during this outbreak and my country is one of them.

In Malaysia, there are few stages of lockdown or movement control order (MCO) implemented by the government.

- Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO)
- Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO)
- Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO)

These are the phases of MCO based on dates:

- Phase 1: 18/03/2020 - 31/03/2020
- Phase 2: 01/04/2020 - 14/04/2020
- Phase 3: 15/04/2020 - 28/04/2020
- Phase 4: 29/04/2020 - 12/05/2020
- Phase 5: 13/05/2020 - 09/06/2020 (CMCO)
- Phase 6: 10/06/2020 - 31/08/2020 (RMCO)

Note: Enhanced MCO (EMCO) only applied to specific locations or states of the country.
