## Strive for Technical Excellence

A great software engineer always aims for technical excellence. They're always trying to get better at what they do, never settling for mediocrity. They know their weaknesses and work hard to improve every aspect of their work.

## Share Your Experiences

Good software engineers share their experiences. They know the value of helping their team by sharing what they've learned. They look for ways to support others and make the whole team better.

## Embrace Challenges

A great software engineer isn't afraid to fail. They don't run away from problems; instead, they face difficult challenges head-on. They're the ones who solve problems and don't shy away from tough situations.

## Stick to Deadlines
