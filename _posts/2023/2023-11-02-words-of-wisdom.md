time is the most important asset.<br>
time does not equal money.<br>
time equals life.<br>
and you only have one chance to make it right.

every human being is fighting a battle inside themselves.<br>
it's your obligation to help and inspire them.<br>
regardless of what you do,<br>
you can always inspire others to do good.

nobody is better than you.<br>
and you're not better than anybody else.<br>
be humble.

being in the comfort zone is wonderful,<br>
but nothing ever grows there.<br>
keep studying.<br>
keep creating.

haters will come if you have the audacity to build something new.<br>
don't let them define you.<br>
don't let them stop you.<br>
just block them and keep going.

don't expect others to make you happy.<br>
you are the only one responsible for your happiness.<br>
don't wait until Friday to enjoy life.<br>
joy should be present in everything you do.

be kind to your parents.<br>
they gave up many things for you.<br>
having millions of people admiring you is worthless,<br>
if you're not admired by your own family.

don't fear the unknown.<br>
fear knowing everything.<br>
life is too damn short and every day counts.<br>
do what you wanna do and do it now.

time doesn't stop.<br>
time doesn't wait.
