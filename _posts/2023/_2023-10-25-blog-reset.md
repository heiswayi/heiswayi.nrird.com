I initiated this blog back in 2015, but now I've made the decision to push the **reset button ↻** on it. The reasons behind this reset are quite straightforward: I sought a fresh direction, greater creative freedom, and a simpler, clutter-free experience for both you and me. This new beginning allows me to delve into fresh ideas, reconnect with my readers, and produce content that truly excites me.

This reset serves as a revitalizing experience, and I eagerly anticipate sharing more stories, insights, and experiences in this new chapter of my blogging journey. While some older blog posts may be revisited and republished with a new perspective, I want to express my gratitude for your support and hope you'll continue to accompany me on this journey.
