Dotfuscated Checker is a simple GUI tool I created with .NET C# and WPF to easily check if the required assemblies from the software build are obfuscated and digitally signed before they can be deployed for a production release. This tool may help Software Quality Assurance Engineers who work with .NET based projects to check for obfuscation at a glance. Other than obfuscation, this tool can check for digital signing too.
