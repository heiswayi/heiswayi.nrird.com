Honestly speaking, I'm really happy using GitHub platform for some of my projects and GitHub Gist for the code snippet service. However, I still find it hard to view all of my repos or gists at a glance of eyes. So, what I wanted is a simple webpage that simply lists all of my repos or gists at a glance of eyes. This way it's more easier to see the projects or gists that I owned without much confusion.

To accomplish this, I have created the listing sites for both of my GitHub repos and gists using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). Similarly to what has been done by big giant corporations such as [Twitter](https://twitter.github.io/), [IBM](https://ibm.github.io/) and [Uber](https://uber.github.io/) to name a few, but mine are more simpler, one-page listing site.
