This would be a reminder note. For me, for you or for the future "programmer". If you can write code, you are the programmer. A computer programmer. And everyone can be a programmer, but not everyone can be a "good" programmer. This post will talk the simple things you can do to be a "good" programmer (or even "better").

### 1. Knowledge and practice

Yes, knowledge and practice. Everyone knows it! You need to stay curious, to learn programming and write the good code. You have to equip yourself with knowledge and soft-skills. Nothing can beat the knowledge. But remember, knowledge itself is not enough if you don't apply that knowledge. To apply, you must do something with it - you have to keep practicing the knowledge i.e. programming. Write whatever code you love, create good applications and solve the real-world problems. Know your tools and keep yourself updated with the technology changes. Also, you can learn more from others code. This is how you grow as a "good" programmer. There's never be the end to learn, the world always has something new for you.

### 2. Write clean code

When you write code to make a living, chasing your dream/passion or contributing for the community, just be the good programmer and write a clean code. This is how you will help others. People can learn easily on what you have done or help to fix and improve for the better. Just write simple, understandable but logical code.

Here are some what you do to write "clean code":

- Be consistent with naming convention. Clear meaning and not too long.
- Avoid writing complex code. Simplify it at your best. Refactor the code if needed.
- Add necessary comment/note into the code, tell what it does and why it was there.
- Delete commented code. 80% of commented code would never be used in the future. If your code is source-controlled, this would be much easier.
- There are some design patterns in programming, use it whenever it is applicable.

Remember this excellent quote:

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?" ~ Steve McConnell

### 3. Analyze and review

If you're dealing with the problem or particular task, before you write code, take some time to analyze the goal or intention you want to achive. Sometimes the solution could be more simpler than you expected, or you may need less time to fix the problem. Understand the problem would help you get better picture when you're design solutions for it.

Code review and feedbacks will help you grow better in becoming the "good" programmer. There are many things you learn from the positive feedbacks, especially when it comes from someone who is more experienced than you. Sometimes, you can always review your code by yourself. The more you learn, the more you would find yourself optimizing and refactoring your code.

I have been applying this simple concept when I write code:

1. _Workable_ - I have to ensure my code work in the way I expected it should be.
2. _Correctness_ - I have to ensure my code work in correct manner.
3. _Simplicity_ - I have to ensure my code is simple and short (KISS concept).
4. _Optimization_ - I have to ensure my code is optimized well, close-to-bug-free and compute at best performance.

### 4. Contribute back to the community

A good programmer will simply contribute back to the community. If you get something from others for free, you should give something back. This is what happening in the open source community. Contributing back to the community does not mean that you have to create something and open source it. Sometimes, you can contribute to other open source projects either submitting bug tickets or becoming one of the contributors that implements the feature or fixes the bug.
