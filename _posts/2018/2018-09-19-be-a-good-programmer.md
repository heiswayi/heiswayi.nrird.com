If you can write code, you are a programmer. Everyone can be a programmer, but not everyone can be a "good" programmer. What I would like to share here are the simple things you can do to be one of the "good" programmers. Perhaps, even better! This is likely would be a reminder note for me, for you or for the future so-called programmer.

### 1. Knowledge and practice

Well, it is all about knowledge. Nothing can beat the knowledge. But the knowledge itself is pointless if you don't apply that knowledge. To gain knowledge, you need to always stay curious (passionate), willing to learn and explore the programming and their best practices. Find your interest and start writing the code. Understand the real-world problems around you and try to solve one by coding it in your favorite programming language. Know your tools and keep yourself updated with the technology changes. Don't forget, one of the quick ways to master is by learning more from others' code. This is how you grow as a programmer. There's never be the end to learn, the world always has something new for you.

### 2. Write clean and beautiful working code

Everyone can write working code, but not everyone can write clean working code. When you write the code to make a good living, chasing your passion or either contributing to the community, remember, just be the good programmer and write a clean code. This is how you will help others too. People can learn and understand easily on what you have done or maybe they can help to fix and improvise for the better. Don't be so complex, just write simple, understandable but logical code.

Following are some of the common good practices in programming that I can summarize:

- Be consistent with the naming convention. Readable, easy to understand and not too long.
- Avoid writing complex code. Simplify it by refactoring the code. Remember the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) from [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).
- Add a necessary note (or comment) if needed into the code, tell **what** it does and **why** it was there.
- There are some good design patterns in programming, use it whenever it's applicable. Design patterns provide good separation and better maintainability.
- Ensure the critical code is testable. Write a unit test for it.

Remember this excellent quote:

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?" ~ Steve McConnell

### 3. Analyze and review

If you're dealing with a problem, _think hard_ before you start to write code. Take some time to analyze the intention that you want to achieve. Sometimes the solution could be more simpler than what you're expecting, so you may need less time to fix the problem. Understand the problem closer would help you get a better picture when you're designing a solution for it.

Code review and feedback will help you grow better in becoming the "good" programmer. There are many things you can learn from the positive feedback, especially when it comes from someone who has more experiences and expert than you. Code review also can be done by yourself. For the laziest option, at least you can use the static code analysis tools. Take some time to review your code, **measure** it and **optimize** it whenever it's necessary so the code can work at its best performance.

When writing the code, I have been applying this simple mind concept based on the following order:

1. _Workable_ - I have to ensure my code work in the way I'm expecting it should be.
2. _Correctness_ - I have to ensure my code work correctly as defined in the requirements.
3. _Simplicity_ - I have to ensure my code is simple and short (KISS concept).
4. _Optimization_ - I have to ensure my code is optimized well, close-to-bug-free and compute at best performance.

### 4. Contributing back to the community

This is optional, but a good programmer will simply contribute back to the community. Once you're good at something or you're able to produce something that has good values, you can help others' problem with your works. It could be in the form of complete source code, portion of code snippets, a functional application or a written technical document. In software community, this is how Open Source community works. Another way is you can become part of the project contributors that help to either develop a feature or do some bugfixes. This is how you make the community a good place to grow yourself as a "good" programmer. Let me give you one great example: be like [Linus Torvards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) who is the creator of Linux, used by billions of devices around the world and it's free for everyone.
