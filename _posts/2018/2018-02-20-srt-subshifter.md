Whenever I am looking for subtitles file, sometimes I get the one that never synchronize well with the movie file I want to watch on my home TV. Usually after I verified the subtitles timeline with the movie, I would go to [this site](http://subshifter.bitsnbites.eu/) and get the subtitles file resynced by adjusting the time shift.

I thought I want to have a simple GUI tool locally in my movie folder. Whevener I need to resync the subtitles file, I can just simply use the tool. Finally I have spent some times to create this simple GUI app called **SRT SubShifter**. It's written in .NET C# and WPF.
