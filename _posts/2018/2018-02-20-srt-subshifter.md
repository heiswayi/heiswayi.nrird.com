Whenever I am looking for subtitles file, sometimes I get the one that never synchronize well with the movie file I want to watch on my home TV. After I verify the subtitles with the movie, I have to go to a particular website to resync the subtitles by adjusting the time shift. Well, I can use a Python script or other script to locally resync the subtitles file, but I think I would prefer to use a simple GUI program to do that. So, I created this simple GUI program called **SRT SubShifter** in .NET C# using WPF code-behind to easily **resync** the subtitles file.
