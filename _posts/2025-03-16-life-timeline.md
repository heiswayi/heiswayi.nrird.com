This week, I finally had the chance to sit down at my PC and complete this simple life timeline app â€” something I've wanted to create for a long time. My goal was to record and visualize significant moments from my daughter life journey, saving them as an image to keep as a lasting memory.

The app is quite straightforward, built with React and designed with a local-first approach. It doesn't rely on a backend; instead, all data is stored directly in the browser's local storage. This is just the initial version of Life Timeline, but it's a meaningful start.
