Time is the most important asset.<br>
Time does not equal money.<br>
Time equals life.<br>
And you only have one chance to make it right.

Every human being is fighting a battle inside themselves.<br>
It's your obligation to help and inspire them.<br>
Regardless of what you do,<br>
you can always inspire others to do good.

Nobody is better than you.<br>
And you're not better than anybody else.<br>
Be humble.

Being in the comfort zone is wonderful,<br>
but nothing ever grows there.<br>
Keep studying.<br>
Keep creating.

Haters will come if you have the audacity to build something new.<br>
Don't let them define you.<br>
Don't let them stop you.<br>
Just block them and keep going.

Don't expect others to make you happy.<br>
You are the only one responsible for your happiness.<br>
Don't wait until Friday to enjoy life.<br>
Joy should be present in everything you do.

Be kind to your parents.<br>
They gave up many things for you.<br>
Having millions of people admiring you is worthless,<br>
if you're not admired by your own family.

Don't fear the unknown.<br>
Fear knowing everything.<br>
Life is too damn short and every day counts.<br>
Do what you wanna do and do it now.

Time doesn't stop.<br>
Time doesn't wait.
