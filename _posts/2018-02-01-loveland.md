In January 2018, my company gave me the chance to travel to Loveland, Colorado, USA for business purposes. I was there for about two weeks during the winter season. It was truly a stunning destination. Here are some photos from around my workplace there.

During my stay, I had the opportunity to explore stunning locales throughout Colorado, including Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, and several other places.

I wished I have a chance to visit Loveland again in the future. I also created a dedicated site for my Loveland trip photography at [https://p.nrird.com/loveland](https://p.nrird.com/loveland).
