Dear friend,  

I hope this letter finds you well. As I've been reflecting on my journey as a software engineer, I wanted to share a few thoughts about what I believe makes someone truly effective in this field. These are ideas I've picked up over the years—simple, practical things that have helped me grow. I'm sharing them in the hope that they might be helpful to you too.

<h2 class="special-font">On mindset of being effective</h2>

First, I've realized that mindset matters a lot. Effective engineers focus on activities that create the most impact for the time they spend. It's not about working more but about working on the right things. The 80/20 rule often applies: 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work. It's worth regularly asking, _"Is this the best use of my time right now?"_

<h2 class="special-font">On optimizing for learning</h2>

Learning is another key piece. Optimizing for learning—whether through challenging tasks, new environments, or conversations with others—has made a big difference for me. Learning compounds over time, and starting early creates exponential growth. If you ever feel stuck in a situation where you're not growing, don't hesitate to look for opportunities elsewhere.

<h2 class="special-font">On prioritization</h2>

Prioritization is something I've struggled with but come to appreciate. It's easy to get caught up in endless tasks, but focusing on what truly produces value makes all the difference. I try to keep a single to-do list, limit multitasking, and set aside focused time for deep work. Saying no to distractions and less important tasks is hard but necessary.

<h2 class="special-font">On iteration speed</h2>

Another thing I've learned is the value of iteration speed. Whether it's shortening debugging loops or automating repetitive tasks, anything that speeds up learning and development is worth investing in. If I find myself repeating a task, I try to build a tool to automate it—it's a small investment with big returns over time.

<h2 class="special-font">On metrics</h2>

Metrics have also been useful for me. They help track progress and guide decisions, but it's important to choose meaningful ones that align with your goals. A good metric focuses your efforts, while a bad one can lead to counterproductive behaviors.

<h2 class="special-font">On simplicity and quality</h2>

Lastly, I've come to value simplicity and quality. Clean, readable code and straightforward systems save so much time and frustration in the long run. It's tempting to chase shiny new technologies, but often the simplest solution is the best.

I'm sharing this not because I have everything figured out—I don't—but because these ideas have helped me, and I hope they might help you too. I'm not looking for feedback or a reply; I just wanted to put this out there as something to reflect on. Take what resonates, and leave the rest.

_Wishing you all the best in your journey,_<br>
