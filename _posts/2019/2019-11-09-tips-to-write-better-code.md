Coding is part of my life. That's what I do the most for living. While I was reading something on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), I came across that someone had mentioned somewhere in the comments about something to consider on writing a better code. I don't really remember which post, to be exact. But I did some quick notes on those. Since then, I have been practicing those 4 elements in my coding, and it helped a lot in improving my code. I think this is something good to share here.

To simplify, whenever you code, just consider these thoughts every time. The code you wrote should be complying with these elements, respectively:

```
Workable -> Correctness -> Simplicity -> Optimization
```

### Workable

First thing first, the code you wrote must be working, can be compiled and can execute whatever thing it's expected to execute. It doesn't matter what kind of method, algorithm, technique or pattern you implemented, the code just needs to work closely in the way you're expecting it should be. If it doesn't, your fancy algorithm would be useless. Then, it's not workable.

### Correctness

If your code is expected to do X, it should do only X, and it is doing X correctly as defined in the requirements and met all the acceptance criteria. Just understand your requirements well before you start coding. Do your best to do it right at first time. If it doesn't, your code quality is questionable. Meaning that, you don't understand your requirements clearly.

### Simplicity

Albert Einstein ever said _"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."_ Do not overthink. Else you'll be delivering something that's "overkill". Embrace the [KISS principle](https://thevaluable.dev/kiss-principle-explained/). Sometimes, your solution to the problem doesn't even need to write a single line of code. Think before you code. Avoid the complex implementation. Simplify it whenever it's necessary.

### Optimization

Measure your code performance, as earlier as possible. Change or update the algorithm for better performance. Optimize your design if necessary. Don't spend so much time here. You're better off completing and delivering your features instead.
