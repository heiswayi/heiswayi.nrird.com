Hello. I'm Heiswayi Nrird -- or just call me "Wayi" for short. Currently I work as a Software Engineer at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. I experiment, code and build stuffs, especially in desktop based apps in .NET, web stuffs and build automation scripting. Sometimes, I love to do [landscape photography](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/) and explore the beauty of mother nature.

Some of my works[^1] that I shared/published can be found on these following sites:-
- [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi)
- [Gist](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/)
- [CodePen](http://codepen.io/heiswayi/)
- [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/user/heiswayi/)

For my professional experience, I can be found on these following links:-
- [My Online Résumé](https://heiswayi.github.io/resume/)
- [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird)

I can be contacted at [hnrird@gmail.com](mailto:hnrird@gmail.com) (the most preferred one).

I also run [nrird·xyz](http://nrird.xyz), a personal project called creative studio that focuses on UX design, front-end app development and data visualization.
