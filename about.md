Hello there, I'm **Heiswayi Nrird**, but most folks simply call me **Wayi**. By profession, I'm a _software engineer_ at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/). My area of expertise lies in full-stack application development and cloud-based infrastructure software solutions.

When I'm not immersed in the world of code, I have a few other interests that keep life interesting. I enjoy capturing the beauty of landscapes through my camera lens. It's a hobby that offers a welcome escape from the digital realm.

I'm also an avid reader of tech articles and news. Staying up to date with the latest in the tech world is something I find both enjoyable and informative. And, like many, I appreciate the occasional computer and mobile game to unwind.

This blog serves as an outlet for my thoughts and experiences, offering a glimpse into various aspects of my life. Sometimes, it's all about coding and web apps, while at other times, it's just a repository for random musings. I hope this brief introduction gives you a clearer picture of who I am and what I'm all about. Thanks for dropping by.
