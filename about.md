Hi, there! I'm Heiswayi Nrird. Call me `Wayi`. I'm a software geek by day, and a gamer by night.

This blog is my Internet home. I write occasionally. A digital tunnel to share my thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, it's all about coding and web stuffs. Other times, it's just a repository for random musings. Anyway, if you read this, thanks for dropping by. ãƒ„
