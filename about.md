hello there, i'm **Heiswayi Nrird**, but most folks simply call me **Wayi**. by profession, i'm a _software engineer_ at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/). my area of expertise lies in full-stack application development and cloud-based infrastructure software solutions.

when i'm not immersed in the world of code, i have a few other interests that keep life interesting. i enjoy capturing the beauty of landscapes through my camera lens. it's a hobby that offers a welcome escape from the digital realm.

i'm also an avid reader of tech articles and news. staying up to date with the latest in the tech world is something i find both enjoyable and informative. and, like many, i appreciate the occasional computer and mobile game to unwind.

this blog serves as an outlet for my thoughts and experiences, offering a glimpse into various aspects of my life. sometimes, it's all about coding and web apps, while at other times, it's just a repository for random musings. i hope this brief introduction gives you a clearer picture of who i am and what i'm all about. thanks for dropping by. ãƒ„
