		<p class="intro-text">Heiswayi Nrird is my official Internet pseudonym. In my real life, people have been calling me <em>Wayi</em>. I'm a 30-yo software engineer based in Penang, Malaysia. I build and ship software at <a href="https://www.keysight.com" target="_blank">Keysight Technologies</a>. I can be reached on <a href="https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for any professional networking.</p>
		<p class="intro-text">Sometimes, I do <em title="Exploring. Coding. Building. Documenting.">some random stuff</em> and write about <em>it</em> here. Other times, I might be <em>away from the city</em> to capture <a href="{{ "/photography" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">some photographs</a> on landscape or may just reading <a href="{{ "/books-i-read" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">some books</a>.</p>

### This site and its technology stack

This is my official home on Internet. I write occasionally here. This is a static site, built based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a popular static site generator. The source code is hosted on my private [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/heiswayi/) account and built and deployed automatically using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Most of the blog posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format.
