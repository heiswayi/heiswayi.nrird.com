Hi, my name is Heiswayi Nrird, but most people call me Wayi. I am currently a software engineer at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/) in Penang, Malaysia.

In my previous careers, I have worked as a Global IT Manager at ITD World and as an Application Engineer at IME Technologies. I have also worked as an app developer at CEDEC USM.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electronics Engineering from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

In my free time, I enjoy designing and coding, contributing to open source projects, playing computer games, taking landscape photographs, reading books, and meditating virtually.

I have expertise in end-to-end software product development, UI/UX design, microservices architecture deployment, AWS/Kubernetes/Docker, web API development, and agile Scrum. I am proficient in HTML + CSS, C#/C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, PHP, and Python/PowerShell.
