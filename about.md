Hi! I'm Heiswayi Nrird. Call me `Wayi`. I'm a software geek by day, and a gamer by night. Currently working as a **software engineer** at [Keysight Technologies](https://keysight.com). This blog is my Internet home. **I write occasionally.** A place I share my thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, it's all about _coding_ and _web stuffs_. Other times, it's just a repository for random musings. ãƒ„
