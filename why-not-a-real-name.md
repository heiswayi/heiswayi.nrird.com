title: Why not a real name?
---

The pseudonym `Heiswayi Nrird` has been with me since the early days of my internet activity. It's the alias I've used for almost everything online. I prefer this pseudonym because it allows me to maintain a level of anonymity in the vast and unpredictable landscape of the internet. To me, the internet is like a wild jungle, and blending in is safer.

The name `Heiswayi Nrird` is a creative blend that reflects aspects of my personality and my real identity. `Heiswayi` represents "he is wayi", signifying my male identity and incorporating a nickname used by my friends. `Nrird` is derived from my real name, adding a unique touch to my online presence. This pseudonym holds special significance for meâ€”it's a representation of my identity and a way to express myself uniquely online.
